## Auto Planters

### Settings

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Enabled** | Enables Auto Planters |
| **Degradation Multiplier** | Increases how quickly fields degrade when placing planters consecutively. Higher values encourage the algorithm to choose different fields |
| **Build Nectars** | Controls how the algorithm builds and maintains nectars. The macro prioritizes building the highest-priority nectars below target and maintaining the lowest nectars above target. When building, the macro focuses on a single nectar until its target is reached |
| **Harvest Automatically / Harvest Fully Grown** | Controls automatic harvesting behavior. **Recommended to set both minimum and maximum hours to 3** |
