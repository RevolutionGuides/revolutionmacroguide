# Gather Tab

The Gather Tab is where you configure all honey farming patterns, boosts, and detection settings.

## Fields Configuration

### Editing a Field

1. Click the **pen icon** to edit a field configuration
2. To paste pre-made settings:
   - Click the **6 dots icon**
   - Select **"Paste"**
3. Find pre-made patterns in the **Revolution Macro Discord** → `#patterns-configs`

### Recommended Approach

- **Copy and paste pre-made settings** from the Discord community
- This ensures optimal routing for different fields
- Custom patterns can be created but require detailed knowledge

### Drift Detection

- Located in field settings under the **pen icon**
- Find the option to **disable drift detection** if needed
- Disabling uses Supreme Saturator for character alignment
- Path: Click pen icon → Find "align" setting under "max backpack" → Disable

### Walk or Reset to Hive

- **Skull Symbol**: Controls character movement type
- **Person Walking Switch**: Toggles between walk and teleport modes
- These are **per-field settings**

## Boosts

### Sprinkler Setup

1. Ensure your **sprinkler is in Slot 1** of your inventory
2. Configure **Slots 2-7** according to your boost preference
3. Slots can contain:
   - Honey pots
   - Stat increase items
   - Other consumable boosts

### Boost Optimization

- Match your sprinkler type to your current equipment
- Use boosts strategically during high-pollen times
- Adjust slot configuration based on field type
