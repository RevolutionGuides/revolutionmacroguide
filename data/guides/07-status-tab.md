# Status Tab

The Status Tab provides real-time monitoring and statistics.

## Real-Time Information

Monitor these key metrics:

- **Current Field**: Active farming location
- **FPS**: Frames per second (aim for 20+ for stability)
- **Honey Rate**: Honey per second production
- **Status**: Current macro operation state
- **Runtime**: How long the macro has been running
- **Errors**: Any active issues or warnings

## Performance Metrics

| Metric           | What It Means                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **FPS**          | Lower FPS = less stable; 20+ recommended |
| **Honey/Second** | Current collection speed                 |
| **Backpack %**   | How full your inventory is               |
| **Time Active**  | Total runtime of current session         |

## Status Indicators

- **Running**: Macro is actively farming
- **Paused**: Macro is paused (F2)
- **Collecting**: Currently collecting/converting
- **Idle**: Waiting for next action
- **Error**: Issue encountered, check logs

## Troubleshooting with Status Tab

1. Check FPS - if too low, adjust graphics settings
2. Monitor honey rate - should be consistent
3. Watch for error messages
4. Note when macro pauses unexpectedly

## Performance Optimization

- Close unnecessary programs to improve FPS
- Adjust Roblox graphics settings down if FPS is low
- Use Status Tab data to identify bottlenecks
- Refer to Troubleshooting section for specific issues
